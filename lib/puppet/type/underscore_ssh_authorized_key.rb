			Manage authorized_keys files for users.
			
			The purpose of this type is just to make sure that entries are
			present or absent in an authorized_keys file in a user's home
			directory.  This is of use mainly when managing a "common" account
			that several people might have access to, such as a generic
			sysadmin account or file storage role account.
			
			In addition to specifying that certain keys must be present or
			absent, you can also tell the type that the authorized_keys file
			should only contain the keys that you explicitly define, and any
			other keys should be removed.  This is similar to the concept of
			"purging" provided in some other types (such as file).  The only
			difference is that with the authorized_keys type, the purging is
			controlled on a per-user basis, by a separate resource.  So if you
			want to enable purging for a user, use something like this:
			
			  authorized_key { read_my_lips:
			      user => johnny,
			      ensure => specified_only
			  }
			
			It's the "specified_only" that tells the type to purge unknown keys
			from the authorized_keys file for the given user.
